    "title": "About Me",
    "description": "I am a {age}-year-old full-stack developer from Germany. I learned programming at school and started developing my first project in early 2023. Since then, I have mostly taught myself what I know. I started an apprenticeship as an IT specialist for application development in August 2025. Since 2023, I have discovered that I have a penchant for developing helpful tools (see <b>SupportMail</b> and <b>Ticketon</b> below) rather than the next React + Next.js AI web app. I love working with SvelteKit for web applications and Node.js/Bun for backend apps (Discord bots).",
